# Branch

## Create branch

    git branch {branch_name}

## Move to branch

    git checkout {branch_name}

### Warning before move you have to clean your current repository (commit) because it will be lost

## Create branch and move to it

    git checkout -b {branch_name}

## Push branch

    git push origin {branch_name}

### Important: if you don't push other people won't be able to acces to your work so push even if it's in dev and not working
